# IMS Challenge: Sentence in a box

* Use Kotlin if possible else you can fall back to Java.
* The repository contains two files (main.kt and mainTest.kt)
  * main.kt is where you will code
  * mainTest.kt contains a simple test which will pass if you solve the challenge
* We recommend to open the project with [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).

## Challenge

Write a function that takes a sentences and prints a single word per line, in a rectangular frame. 

For example the list **"Hello World in a frame"** gets printed as:

```
*********
* Hello *
* World *
* in    *
* a     *
* frame *
*********
```

Another example with the sentence **"Hello Mercury in a box"** gets printed as:

```
***********
* Hello   *
* Mercury *
* in      *
* a       *
* box     *
***********
```
